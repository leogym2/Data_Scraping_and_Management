# Data_Scraping_and_Management

*Insider Trading and Stock Market Analysis*

This project aims to explore the relationships between the stock market and the transactions of insiders (which include every director, officer, and owner of more than 10 percent of a class of a particular companyâ€™s equity).

After illustrating the processes of collecting, storing, and integrating the data, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is reported.

The base question is whether insiders can make their decisions of buying or selling anticipating a favorable move in the stock price.

The SEC offers a pre-defined automatic buying and selling plan (10b5-1 Plan) that insiders can adopt to avoid future obligations of trading with material non-public information (MNPI). Also, companies typically set a period where insiders cannot make transactions (for example, near earnings periods). Nevertheless, in the end, they can maintain a certain degree of flexibility.

The results show that there is some evidence of a relationship between the stock market and the transactions of insiders. However, there is a need to inspect each individual company in order to understand the specific case and be able to explain how this relationship works.
